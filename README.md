# 💼 Job Offer Letter Analyser

**Job Offer Letter Analyser** is a tool that helps users analyze job offer letters to make well-informed career decisions. It extracts and interprets critical elements like salary, benefits, clauses, deadlines, and highlights potential negotiation opportunities using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 Extracts key details from job offer letters:
  - Salary
  - Designation
  - Benefits
  - Start date
  - Clauses and conditions
- ⚠️ Highlights missing or ambiguous information
- 💬 Suggests negotiation opportunities *(Coming soon)*
- 📊 Scoring and benchmarking of job offers *(Planned)*

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Navi-1105/job-offer-letter-analyser.git
cd job-offer-letter-analyser
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.8 or above installed.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is not yet created, you can install basic packages manually:

```bash
pip install nltk spacy pandas
```

> Run this to download NLTK data if using NLTK:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
```

---

## 🧪 Usage

Place your job offer letter (in `.txt` format) inside the `samples/` directory.

Then run:

```bash
python analyser.py
```

> Replace `analyser.py` with the actual filename of your main script.

The extracted information and insights will be printed to the console or saved in the `outputs/` folder (if implemented).
